RAM has different types when it comes to DIMM and SODIMM as DIMM memory is what is used in desktop computers and servers as they are larger components and SODIMM is a smaller memory device used in laptops. SODIMM and DIMM memory devices are also not interchangable as they vary in sizes and memory needs to be compatible with the motherboard of the computer. RAM also has different generations of DDR RAM that is referred to as DDR1/2/3/4/5. These different generations of DDR RAM also need to match the compatibility with the motherboard to be installed, as in my pictures of my current computer, my device currently can only be compatible with DDR4 DIMM RAM. The different generations of RAM vary in different capabilities of speed and power efficiency.
