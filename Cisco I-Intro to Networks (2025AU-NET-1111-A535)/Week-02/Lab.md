I ran into a few hiccups with mnot being able to ping other devices and realized that I forgot to connect a modem to the router to provide the internet for the pings to function. I did also forget to use a switch connected to the router and just connected them using the copper straight through for all of the connections to the router. Connecting the wireless devices was a little harder as it was not cooperating with me on entering the password for the network. (I kept forgetting to hit save)
